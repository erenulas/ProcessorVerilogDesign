# Verilog Design of a Processor
It's the implementation of a processor in Verilog programming language. 
- Logisim design of the same processor can be reached from [here](https://github.com/erenulas/ProcessorLogisimDesign).
- Assembler for this processor implemented in Python programming language can be found [here](https://github.com/erenulas/Assembler).

## How to Use It?
* Clone the repo.
* Make sure that the verilog codes are in the same location with your file containing the instructions (assembler's output file for verilog).
* Run the simulation.
